We are hosting a three-day virtual NDN Hackathon (Oct 22-24, 2021). The event is open and FREE to participate in and winners will receive exciting prizes! This event targets all levels of participants and, particularly for beginners, will be an excellent opportunity to get started with NDN.

<!--#### **Attendees: Please join via [Zoom](https://arizona.zoom.us/j/86129306505?pwd=VTZDMEhGQnU0TDZZZDR3K1hZRmpmZz09)**-->

We particularly encourage projects that:
